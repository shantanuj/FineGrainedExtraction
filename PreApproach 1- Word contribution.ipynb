    "#### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Baseline simple method: BiLSTM + CRF.  This is a baseline model. We need a model with high coverage (high false positives) and then trim the selection using the below model. This can either be simple rules, syntactic structures, just any model with high number of false positives. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Given a sentence S, train an encoder-decoder network to reproduce the sentence. Compute last hidden state representation based on model M (S-> S). After training for a while, for each sentence: for each aspect word: remove BA, IA labelled words, and get representation. 2nd model takes this representation and the original sentence + some noisy cases and outputs a 1 or 0 depending on task. Effectively, 2nd model is learning to use incomplete representation and other info to learn whether it is an aspect/opinion term. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out word contribution, by training a model based on missing words. So, if a word is removed, get some representation. Embed the ones with aspects missing to a similar space. Meaning if I have a sentence: I love their ice-cream so much. Then remove ice-cream, get a representation of the sentence, and a representation of the normal (with ice-cream sentence). Using these representations, map as similar (1) in a Siamese net. Now take all other (except opinion terms) and use same model to get representation. But the final model outputs the representations as dissimilar.\n",
    "\n",
    "    G(F(I love their so much), F(I love their ice cream so much)) = 1\n",
    "    G(F(love their ice cream so much), F(I love their ice cream so much)) = 0\n",
    "    G(F(I love their ice cream), F(I love their ice cream so much)) = 2\n",
    "    G(F(I love ice cream so much), F(Sentence)) = \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        Another approach could be if we remove the word then from all the mined words, if we replace the term with it, does the sentence still make sense (is it legible)-> then it is an aspect word. \n",
    "\n",
    "        So given s= I love their ice cream so much, if we remove ice-cream then replace it with say 50 previous aspect words like -> football, passing, nachos, ambience, does it still make sense? A model M is trained to identify whether a sentence still makes sense. \n"
