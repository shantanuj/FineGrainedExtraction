    "### Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we make a general system to identify key aspect words and key opinion words. While AI systems (rapid domain expert babies) would be highly specialized in learning domain specific knowledge, they should also exhibit general human level linguistic parsing. <b>Ideally a system should be able to:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Detect key topics and human opinion in any converstation/parsing of text. \n",
    "2. Inform when it is not able to confidently do so. Learn from user, and adapt to domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub Problems\n",
    "1) Extract aspect and opinion words from given sentence.\n",
    "> Example 1: \"I enjoyed the dinner roll at Starbucks, and service as usual was quick; however, the coffee was bland\"\n",
    ">> Aspects:  dinner roll at Starbucks; service; coffee\n",
    ">> /Opinions: enjoyed; quick; bland \n",

    "> Example 2: \"I love the prospect of building reasoning networks with access to multiple processors for understanding.\" \n",
    ">> Aspects: prospect of building reasoning networks with acess.... understanding \n",
    ">> /Opinions: love\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Given a sentence, tag each word/token as one of the following: {BA, IA, BO, IO, N}\n",
    ">> In example1: N BO N/BA BA/IA IA IA IA N BA N N N BA \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Transfer model to another distribution/domain of inputs. Ideally model requires 0 new labels for transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Propose methods for tutoring and confidence scores for domain transfer. (Learn new properties, modify objective parameters, etc)\n"
